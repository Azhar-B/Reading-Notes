# HTML & CSS Chapter 18

## Goals for Chapter
1. How to approach building a site
2. Understanding your audience and their needs
3. How to present information visitors want to see

Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is. Questions you should ask: 

1. Target Audience: Individuals
    * What is the age range of your target audience?
    * Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
    * Which country do your visitors live in?
    * Do they live in urban or rural areas?
    * What is the average income of visitors?
    * What level of education do they have?
    * What is their marital or family status?
    * What is their occupation?
    * How many hours do they work per week?
    * How often do they use the web?
    * What kind of device do they use to access the web?
2. Target Audience: Companies
    * What is the size of the company or relevant department?
    * What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
    * Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
    * How large is the budget they control?

Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

1. The first attempts to discover the underlying **motivations** for why visitors come to the site. Key motivations to consider:
    * Are they looking for general entertainment or do they need to achieve a specific goal?
    * If there is a specific goal, is it a personal or professional one?
    * Do they see spending time on this activity as essential or a luxury?
2. The second examines the specific **goals** of the visitors. These are the triggers making them come to the site now.
    * Do they want general info/research (such as background on a topic/company), or are they after something specific (such as a particular fact or information on a product)
    * Are they already familiar with the service or product that you offer or do they need to be introduced to it?
    * Are they looking for time sensitive information, such as the latest news or updates on a particular topic?
    * Do they want to discover information about a specific product or service to help them decide whether to buy it or not?
    * Do they need to contact you? If so, can they visit in person (which might require opening hours and a map)? Or might they need email or telephone contact details?

You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively. 
* Key information:
    * Will visitors be familiar with your subject area / brand or do you need to introduce yourself?
    * Will they be familiar with the product / service / information you are covering or do they need background information on it?
    * What are the most important features of what you are offering?
    * What is special about what you offer that differentiates you from other sites that offer something similar?
    * Once people have achieved the goal that sent them to your site, are there common questions people ask about this subject area?

Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static. Here are some questions to help you decide how often to update your website content:
1. Goods / Services
    * How often do the same people return to purchase from you?
    * How often is your stock updated or your service changed?
2. Information
    * How often is the subject updated?
    * What percentage of your visitors would return for regular updates on the subject, compared with those who will just need the information once?

The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a **site map** and it will show how those pages can be grouped.
To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called **card sorting**

A lot of designers will take the elements that need to appear on each page and start by creating **wireframes**. This involves sketching or shading areas where each element of the page will go (such as the logo, primary navigation, headings and main bodies of text, user logins etc). By creating a **wireframe** you can ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included. You should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website in the **wireframe**. It should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page

The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

1. Content
    * Web pages often have a lot of information to communicate. For example, the pages of online newspapers will have information that does not appear on every page of the print equivalent:
        * A masthead or logo
        * Links to navigate the site
        * Links to related content and other popular articles
        * Login or membership options
        * Ability for users to comment
        * Copyright information
        * Links to privacy policies, terms and conditions, advertising information, RSS feeds, subscription options
2. Prioritizing
    * If everything on a page appeared in the same style, it would be much harder to understand. (Key messages would not stand out.)
    * By making parts of the page look distinct from surrounding content, designers draw attention to (or away from) those items
    * Designers create something known as a visual hierarchy to help users focus on the key messages that will draw people's attention and then guide them to subsequent messages
3. Organizing
    * Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler (and easier to understand)
    * Users should be able to identify the purpose of each block without processing each individual item.
    * By presenting certain types of information in a similar visual style (such as using the same style for all buttons or all links), users will learn to associate that style with a particular type of content

Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.

1. SIZE: Larger elements will grab users' attention first. For this reason it is a good idea to make headings and key points relatively large
2. COLOR: Foreground and background color can draw attention to key messages. Brighter sections tend to draw users' attention first.
3. Style: An element may be the same size and color as surrounding content but have a different style applied to it to make it stand out

When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved: 
1. Proximity: When several items are placed close together, they percieved as more related than items that are placed further apart. 
2. Closure: When faced with a complicated arrangement of items, we will often look for a single or recognisable pattern or form. A real or imaginary box can be formed around elements due to their proximity and alignment. 
3. Continuance: When elements are placed in a line or a curve then they are percieved to be more related than those that are not following the same direction. THis can be used to direct a reader from one part of a page to the next.
4. White Space: Placing related items closer together and leaving a bigger gap between unrealted items
5. Color: A background color placed behind related to emphasize their connection.
6. Borders: A line can be drawn around the border of the group or between it and its neighbors.

Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.Good navigation tends to follow these principles...
1. Concise: Ideally, the navigation should be quick and easy to read. It is a good idea to try to limit the number of options in a menu to no more than eight links. These can link to section homepages which in turn link to other pages.
2. Clear: Users should be able to predict the kind of information that they will find on the page before clicking on the link. Where possible, choose single descriptive words for each link rather than phrases
3. Selective: The primary navigation should only reflect the sections or content of the site. Functions like logins and search, and legal information like terms and conditions and so on are best placed elsewhere on the page.
