## Growth Mindset
A Growth Mindset is a mentality that centers the ability to improve over natural talent. **Effort** and **consistency** outweigh any supposed natural affinity. The growth mindset seeks to develop an outlook of the world where there is oppurtunity to learn in every interaction and experience. When faced with difficulty and adversity, a person with a growth mindset will **persists** and continue forward no matter the challenge. The growth mindset in short is simply the development of learning as a skill and its continous application in our daily lives. To quote Steven Haffenden,
>A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.


### Reminders Towards A Growth Mindset
When encountering difficulty, take a step back, calm down, and then return the problem.
Ask what is most important: the tempoarary feeling of gratification or the feeling of success.
It is always hardest in the beginning

Features to Look for in a text-editor:
1. code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
2. syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue) 
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. Extensions are like plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that you wouldn’t have otherwise.
