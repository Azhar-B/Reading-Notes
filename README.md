## Growth Mindset
A Growth Mindset is a mentality that centers the ability to improve over natural talent. **Effort** and **consistency** outweigh any supposed natural affinity. The growth mindset seeks to develop an outlook of the world where there is oppurtunity to learn in every interaction and experience. When faced with difficulty and adversity, a person with a growth mindset will **persists** and continue forward no matter the challenge. The growth mindset in short is simply the development of learning as a skill and its continous application in our daily lives. To quote >  A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
