# Reading Notes
## Growth Mindset
A Growth Mindset is a mentality that centers the ability to improve over natural talent. **Effort** and **consistency** outweigh any supposed natural affinity. The growth mindset seeks to develop an outlook of the world where there is oppurtunity to learn in every interaction and experience. When faced with difficulty and adversity, a person with a growth mindset will **persists** and continue forward no matter the challenge. The growth mindset in short is simply the development of learning as a skill and its continous application in our daily lives. To quote Steven Haffenden,
>A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.


### Reminders Towards A Growth Mindset
When encountering difficulty, take a step back, calm down, and then return the problem.
Ask what is most important: the tempoarary feeling of gratification or the feeling of success.
It is always hardest in the beginning

## Choosing A Text Editor

### What is A Text Editor

A text editor is a piece of software used to write and manage text for software developing.
Features to Look for in a text-editor:
1. code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
2. syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue) 
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. Extensions are like plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that you wouldn’t have otherwise. A text editor that has a great selection of extension will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality as you need it.

### Types of Code Editors
#### Installed Editors
There are two text editors already installed into most computers. On Macs, this is called Text Edit and on Windows, this is called Notepad. Linus computers will have their own text editors dependent on the distrubution the indvidual has. The text editors are very bare bones and lacking in many helpful features. 
#### Third-Party Text Editors
There are many third-party editors that people can downloaded. Some are free and some have to be paid for. The following is a list of third-party text editors commonly used.
1. NotePad++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only. NotePad++ has been around for many years and many web developers swear by NotePad++. It has syntax highlighting and code completion, as well as word completion and function completion. It has a zoom in an out feature, it’s own online community, and its own chat room for questions that may arise. It even has its own searchable wiki page for more assistance
2. TextWrangler is for Mac computers only, and you used to be able to download it from the Mac App Store. In doing my research for this blog post, I’ve come to find out that TextWrangler has been retired. I know, I’m a little late to the party with this news, but TextWrangler was retired in 2017. This was one of the go-to text editors for Mac Computers.
3. BB Edit is software that you purchase. But BB Edit comes with a 30-day free trial. After the 30 days is over, if you still want the free version, simply continue using BB Edit, and you’ll get the same features as you would have gotten in TextWrangler. If you want the full features in BB Edit, the full cost for a full license is $49.99.
4. Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft. It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS already built-in with no additional work from you at all. VS Code has everything: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code completion. It seems like VS Code has a very healthy following in the web developing community.
5. Atom is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. Atom is brought to you by the folks at GitHub . GitHub is a great service online where you can host and review code, or you can post and get help with the development of your own projects. Atom also ticks all the right boxes. It has syntax highlighting, themes, extensions, the works! Atom is definitely a software to check out and test drive for yourself.
6. Brackets is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. It’s made and maintained by the good folks at Adobe—yep, the Photoshop people. Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, though more coding capabilities can be added through extensions. Being that Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this might be a great choice to start with. But still the choice is yours. Brackets includes all of the features one may want when using a text editor including something called “Live Preview” which updates your website once you make a change automatically.
7. Sublime Text 3 is a premium software that can be purchased in full for $70. Otherwise you’ll use the free version. Sublime Text enjoys a history of being fast and responsive while being extensible as well. There’s no doubt that Sublime Text will tick the check boxes of what to look for in a text editor. It has syntax highlighting, it has code completion, it has themes and extensions. And will definitely get the job done no matter how advanced you get with your coding.
### The Difference Between Text Editors and Integrated Development Environment (IDEs)
An IDE is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. It is commonly used by more experienced coders as it filled with more features.
