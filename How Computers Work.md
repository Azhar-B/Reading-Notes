# How Computers Work:

## What Makes A Computer A Computer:

A computer is a thinking machine and it has four parts:
1. Take input
	1. The external input that causes computer to do things
2. Store information
	1. All input give computers information, which is stored in memory
3. Process it
	1. The information is taken and is manipulated or changes it using an algorithm
		1. An algorithm is a series of commands
	2. Sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again
4. Output the results
	1. How a computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do.

## Binary & Data

Binary is how you store or represent information using electricity. 
1. The on-and-off state of a wire is called a bit. The smallest unit of information a computer can store.
	1. On-Off
	2. Yes-No
	3. True-False
	4. 1-0
	
2. Binary Number System
	1. There is only two digits: one and zero.
	2. 1-0-1-0
		1. 1st Position
		2. 2nd Position
		3. 4th Position
		4. 8th Position
	3. (9)=1-0-0-1
		1. (1x8)+(0x4)+(0x2)+(1x1)=9
	
3. Text, Images, and Sound can all be represented with numbers.
	1. Text in Binary
		1. A letter gets represented by a number.
	2. Images in Binary
		1. Images are made out of pixels.
		2. Each pixel has a color and each color is represented with numbers.
		3. Sound in Binary
			1. Sound is represented as a waveform.
			2. Any point on this waveform can be represented by a number.
			3. Sound can be broken down into a series of numbers. 
## Circuits and Logic

Circuits are millions of electronic components.
1. A simple circuits takes an electric signal and flips it.
	1. If a signal gives you one, the circuit gives you a zero.
		1. Signal that goes in is not the same as the signal that comes out, and so we call this circuit not. 
2. More complicated circuits can take multiple signals and combine them.
	1. A circuit will take two electic signals, now each one might be a one or a zero. If either of the signals coming in as zero, then the result will be zero.
	2. And is circuit where both signals are one.
		1. This is a logic gate which preform simple logical calculations.
3. Modern circuits can preform billions of calculations per second because electricity moves at the speed of light.
