## How To Write A Script for a Webpage

### How HTML, CSS, & Javascript Fit Together

#### Structure of a Website

Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose. Each layer, from left to right builds on the previous one:
* HTML is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.
* The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgroundsm borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.)
* This is where people can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our Javascript as possible in separate files.
This is often referred to as separations of concerns.

#### Progressive Enhancement

These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement.
* Starting with the HTML layer allows to focus on the most important thing about the site: its content. Being plain HTML, this layer should work on all kinds of devices, be accessible to all users, and load quite quickly on slow connections.
* Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself. People can use the same style sheet with all of sites, making the sites faster to load and easier to maintain or they can use different style sheets with the same content to create different views of the same data.
* The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site. Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. They can also reuse the code on several pages (making the site faster to load and easier to maintain).

#### Creating a Basic Javascript

JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day.
When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML script element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.
You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files).

## Basic Javascript Instructions

#### Statements

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 
* JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means something different to HourNow or HOURNOW. 
A statement is an individual instruction that the computer should follow. Each one should start on a new line and end with a semicolon. This makes your code easier to read and follow. The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter when a step is over, indicating that it should move to the next step.
Some statements are surrounded by curly braces; these are known as code blocks. The closing curly brace is not followed by a semicolon. Above, each code block contains one statement related to what the current time is. Code blocks will often be used to group together many more statements. This helps programmers organize their code and makes it more readable.

#### Comments

You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. To write a comment that stretches over more than one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with the /* characters and ending with the */ characters. Anything between these characters is not processedÂ· by the JavaScript interpreter. M ulti-line comment s are often used for descriptions of how the script works, or to prevent a section of the script from running when testing it. In a single-line comment, anything that follows the two forward slash characters I/ on that line will not be processed by the JavaScript interpreter. Singleline comments are often used for short descriptions of what the code is doing. Good use of comments will help you if you come back to your code after several days or months. They also help those who are new to your code.

#### Variable

A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. When you write JavaScript, you have to tell the interpreter every individual step that you want it to perform. This sometimes involves more detail than you might expect.
This also illustrates how a script (contains very explicit instructions about exactly what you want the computer to do.) You can compare variables to short-term memory, because once you leave the page, the browser will forget any information it holds.
A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs. No matter what the dimensions of any individual wall are, you know that you can find its area by multiplying the width of that wall by its height. Similarly, scripts often need to achieve the same goal even when they are run with different data, so variables can be used to represent values in your scripts that are likely to change. The result is said to be calculated or computed using the data stored in the variables. The use of variables to represent numbers or other kinds of data is very similar to the concept of algebra (where le.tters are used to represent numbers). There is one key difference, however. The equals sign does something very different in programming.

#### Data Types

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans:
1. The numeric data type handles numbers. For tasks that involve counting or calculating sums, you will use numbers 0-9. For example, five thousand, two hundred and seventy-two would be written 5272 (note there is no comma between the thousands and the hundreds). You can also have negative numbers (such as -23678) and decimals (three quarters is written as 0.75).
2. The strings data type consists of letters and other characters. The string data type is enclosed within a pair of quotes. These can be single or double quotes, but the opening quote must match the closing quote. Strings can be used when working with any kind of text. They are frequently used to add new content into a page and they can contain HTML markup.
3. Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false. It might seem a little abstract at first, but the Boolean data type is actually very helpful. You can think of it a little like a light switch - it is either on or off.Booleans are helpful when determining which part of a script should run.

#### Rules for Naming Variables

1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number. 
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript.
4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, firstName might be used to store a person's first name, lastNarne for their last name, and age for their age.
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a 
capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, firstName rather than firstnarne (this is referred to as camel case). You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash).
